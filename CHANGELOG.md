* BREAKING CHANGE: parameter `type` renamed to `mimeType`.
* BREAKING CHANGE: `filePath` parameter is now not nullable instead of null value check with assert. 
* BREAKING CHANGE: `linuxDesktopName` parameter removed, will always use `xdg-open` on Linux. If there's a reason to use anything else, there should be a way to detect xdg availability and perhaps it should be a part of the library.
* BREAKING CHANGE: `linuxByProcess` parameter removed, will always use FFI to open files on Linux. The reasoning behind its existence is unclear, if there's a demand for the Process alternative, the use cases should be properly documented.  
* BREAKING CHANGE: web implementation changed in favor of creating a dynamic `AnchorElement` with provided file URL and trying to download the associated file by clicking on it.
* Provided clearer explanations of `mimeType` and `uti` parameters.
* Extended example to cover basic cases for different platforms.
